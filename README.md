# Psychic-Game
This is a letter guessing game. The game runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
The player must pick the same letter as the secret random letter generated by the computer to win the game. 

# How to Use:
1. Type is any letter to see if your choice matches the secret random letter.
2. Notice that the computer will list your choices in the Guesses so far section. 
3. Pick up to 9 different letters to try and win!
4. If you win, the computer will display a pop-up letting you know you picked the correct letter and your wins       will increase by one. 
5. If you lose, the computer will display a pop-up letting you know you lost and your losses will increase by       one.
6. The game will automatically restart. 

**Motivation:** To employ JavaScript to dynamically update elements retrieved from the DOM by ID. 

**Code Style:** Tab

**Tech/Framework:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Arrays, Keypress Listeners

**Features:** Dynamically updated content, user input

**Code Example:**
```javascript
document.onkeyup = function(event) {
    
    // if the key pressed is not a letter, do nothing
    if (event.keyCode < 65 || event.keyCode > 90) {
        return;
    };
 
    // make the keypress lowercase
    var currentGuess = event.key.toLowerCase();

    if (currentGuess == winLetter) {                                 // user guessed correctly
        intWins = intWins + 1;
        winLetter = alphArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * 26)];
        intGuessesLeft = 9;
        lettersPicked = "";
        alert ("You won by pressing the mystery letter!")
    } else if (currentGuess != winLetter && intGuessesLeft > 1) {    // user guessed incorrectly ...
        intGuessesLeft = intGuessesLeft - 1;
        lettersPicked = lettersPicked + currentGuess + ", ";
    } else if (currentGuess != winLetter && intGuessesLeft == 1) {   // ... and has no guesses left
        intLosses = intLosses + 1;
        winLetter = alphArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * 26)];

        intGuessesLeft = 9;
        lettersPicked = "";
        alert ("You lost by pressing nine wrong letters! Try again!")
    };
```
